    I worked 9 weeks with the Weroom team in early 2014. My mission was to write
    a technical roadmap, implement an agile & continuous deployment process and ramp
    up the design team. I worked closely with two of the designers who managed to
    become front-end developer (from Illustrator to Sublime + Terminal), which is IMHO the best
    way to grow your technical team.
